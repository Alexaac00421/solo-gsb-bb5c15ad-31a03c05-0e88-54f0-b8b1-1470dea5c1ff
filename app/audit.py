"""Tamper-evident audit chain for recovery-session state changes.

Every state-changing business transaction appends an audit event (rotation
appends one to each of the old and the new session). Events deliberately hold
only non-sensitive metadata -- a session identifier, an event type, a UTC
timestamp and a coarse result plus a few counters/links. Keys, raw shares,
share tokens and digests are never written to the audit log.

Chain construction (per session)::

    seq:        starts at 1 and is contiguous
    prev_hash:  event_hash of the previous event ("" for the genesis event)
    event_hash: SHA-256(prev_hash + canonical_event_content)

The canonical event content is a compact JSON document with sorted keys and no
insignificant whitespace, so hashes are reproducible on any platform::

    {"details":{...},"result":"...","seq":1,"session_id":"...",
     "timestamp":"...","type":"..."}

A targeted modification of any historical field (or of a previous hash) breaks
the hash at that event and at every event built on top of it; verification
walks the chain using the *stored* predecessor hash, which localises the first
failing sequence number.
